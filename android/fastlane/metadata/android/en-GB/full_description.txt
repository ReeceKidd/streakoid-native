Streakoid is a simple and easy to use task tracker that lets you define daily tasks that you need to complete in to reach your goals. 

What makes Streakoid different is that it is a social tracker. Which means you and your friends can compete and work together to build your streaks.

This level of accountability to your friends makes Streakoid the most effective way to achieve your goals.  

Streakoid is a daily task tracker because you don't achieve great things with miracles. You achieve great things by working consistently everyday. Improving a little bit each day leads to exponential results. 

The almighty Oid (the little robot) will watch over. Sending you reminders and making sure you're working towards your goals each day. 

You can compete with other users with similar interests via challenge streaks.

Or work together and form a team.  With a team streak if one of you doesn't do your daily task you all lose your streak. You don't want to be the one to let the team team. 

Leaderboards allow you to see how you stack up against the rest of the world.
