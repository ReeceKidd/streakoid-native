Sticking to new habits or breaking old ones can be stressful. What if building new habits was enjoyable? No more lack of progress, frustration or anger when building new habits. Streakoid will help you on your way to a better version of yourself living your best life. Our goal is to help you build simple daily habits that will lead to massive long term results. Small things that only take a few minutes of your time throughout the day. Sounds simple, doesnâ€™t it?

Build your routine for long term success: create your habits and organize your daily routines. Habits are shown in your daily to-do list. Need a reminder? That's not a problem, you can schedule an individual notification for each habit. Just tap the habit circle after completing it and view your progress.

Track your progress with Streakoid: complete habits and view your progress over time. It is simple and intuitive. Forgot to tap yesterday? You can use Oid coins earnt in the app to recover your streaks.

Build habits with friends: Most habit apps force you to try and build better habits alone. We don't like that! Instead invite your friends to build habits together with team streaks. If one of you doesn't do the daily habit you both lose the streak. 

Compete: View leaderboards to make being consistent more interesting.

Level up: Unlock coins, XP and achievements as you build better habits. 

Learn with Streakoid: Get inspiration from other users profiles and use our habit case studies to copy the habits and routines of other top performers.

Your free account is waiting for you, no registration needed! You get up to 5 streaks, custom reminders and much more! We're always working on new features. If you feel upgrading you can support the development by subscribing to our membership. You can unlock unlimited habits and more!
